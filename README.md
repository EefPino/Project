**Problem Statement**
What is the amount of criminality for each country?

This visualization is designed to collect data of reported crime with the goal to improve the spread of that information.
* Geregistreerde criminaliteit per gemeente (2015-2010)
* Wereld: UNODC Global Crime Statistics
* VS: criminaliteit vs leeftijf vs ras

There is a clearly defined problem that a reasonably large group of people have, which an app or visualization can solve particularly well.
There is a widespread lack of knowledge or understanding that an interactive visualization is particularly suited to remedy.
The project should answer a clearly defined question, or help readers answer those questions, through a self-explanatory website. The website needs to tell a story. The story and website should be reasonably original with regards to interactive visualizations that have previously been published.
In both cases, you should be able to define a target audience who have specific interests that match your project. Include that, too.
In total, keep the problem statement to four or five lines of text.
a paragraph summary of the application goals at the top.

**Solutions**

Summarize your idea in a single sentence, connecting it to the “gap” that you describe.
Include a visual sketch of what the final product will look like for the user; if you envision the application to have multiple screens, sketch these all out separately. Clearly specify the possible user interactions, and include concrete examples of data. Your sketches do not have to be professional-looking, but they have to be complete and neat!

__Views__
The final product must implement at the very least 3 linked interactive views showing different aspects of the data, as well as at least 2 other interactive components (e.g. table, dropdown, checkbox, etc.).
At least one view should comprise a visualization that you have not implemented in earlier courses. At least one interactive component has to be connected to data (e.g., resulting in variable or dataset change).
The final product embodies good visualization practices.

__Examples__
Include a list of main features that will be available to users. All features should also be visible in the sketch. Keep it brief.
Split the features into 1) the minimum viable product (MVP) and 2) parts that are optional to implement.
A minimum viable product is the product with as least features as possible, which still helps solve the problem for your target audience. We think it’s important to clearly define this, because it defines the minimum amount of work that you will have to put into the project.
Other parts of your project may be optional to implement or “nice to have”.

__Data sets__
You are invited to work on the basis of one or more data sets that you haven’t used in earlier courses, as long as these allow a visualization of sufficient complexity to be created (pending approval by the course’s instructor).
