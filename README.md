**Problem Statement**

What is the amount of criminality for each country?
This visualization is designed to collect data of reported crime with the goal to improve the spread of that information. It will be visualized by a map of the world with different colors indicating the amount of crimes (percentual). You can click on some countries which will be zoomed in which you can see the counties. Probably the crimes will be divided and by scrolling over a country you can see a bar plot of the different types of crimes (may be with the ages etc. of the criminals). Maybe there will also be arrows with the amount of emigration of criminals per country. (This depend on the amount of work) 

**Solutions**

Summarize your idea in a single sentence, connecting it to the “gap” that you describe.
Include a visual sketch of what the final product will look like for the user; if you envision the application to have multiple screens, sketch these all out separately. Clearly specify the possible user interactions, and include concrete examples of data. Your sketches do not have to be professional-looking, but they have to be complete and neat!

Probably the crimes will be divided and by scrolling over a country you can see a bar plot of the different types of crimes (may be with the ages etc. of the criminals). Maybe there will also be arrows with the amount of emigration of criminals per country.
There wil

The final product must implement at the very least 3 linked interactive views showing different aspects of the data, as well as at least 2 other interactive components (e.g. table, dropdown, checkbox, etc.).
At least one view should comprise a visualization that you have not implemented in earlier courses. At least one interactive component has to be connected to data (e.g., resulting in variable or dataset change).
The final product embodies good visualization practices.

__Examples__

Include a list of main features that will be available to users. All features should also be visible in the sketch. Keep it brief.
Split the features into 1) the minimum viable product (MVP) and 2) parts that are optional to implement.
A minimum viable product is the product with as least features as possible, which still helps solve the problem for your target audience. We think it’s important to clearly define this, because it defines the minimum amount of work that you will have to put into the project.
Other parts of your project may be optional to implement or “nice to have”.

__Data sets__

(There are multiple other data sets, which I maybe will also use. But for now this is enough. A friend of my has a data set about the migration of criminals which I also want to have.)
1. Globally data of reported crime (1990-1994) with different types of it and compared to different variables like age of suspects. 
https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/studies/3686/version/1/summary
2. This data exists of crimes in counties and quarters (2010-2015) about property crimes, vandalism, crimes against public order and authority and violent and sexual crimes.

3. Globally data of crimes about assault, kdinapping, theft, robbery, burglary, motor vehicle theft and sexual violence. (+- 2003-2015)

4. Data about the crimanility of the Netherlands with respect to age, gender and delctgroup. (2015-2017)
