**Problem Statement**

What is the amount of criminality for each country?
This visualization is designed to collect data of reported crime with the goal to improve the spread of that information. It will be visualized by a map of the world with different colors indicating the amount of crimes (percentual). You can click on some countries which will be zoomed in which you can see the counties. Probably the crimes will be divided and by scrolling over a country you can see a bar plot of the different types of crimes (may be with the ages etc. of the criminals). Maybe there will also be arrows with the amount of emigration of criminals per country. (This depend on the amount of work) 

**Solutions**

Summarize your idea in a single sentence, connecting it to the “gap” that you describe.
Include a visual sketch of what the final product will look like for the user; if you envision the application to have multiple screens, sketch these all out separately. Clearly specify the possible user interactions, and include concrete examples of data. Your sketches do not have to be professional-looking, but they have to be complete and neat!

Maybe there will also be arrows with the amount of emigration of criminals per country.
There will be a search function in which you can type a country (or county) and you will get a bar chart of the crimes.

__Data sets__

(There are multiple other data sets, which I maybe will also use. But for now this is enough. A friend of my has a data set about the migration of criminals which I also want to have.)
1. Globally data of reported crime (1990-1994) with different types of it and compared to different variables like age of suspects.
