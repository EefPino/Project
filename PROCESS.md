Change my Project Proposal by changing the text and adding pictures of visualizations in the README.

__08-01-2018__
Made a Design Document with a list of data sources with information of transforming the data, a diagram with an overview of the technical components (visualizations), descriptions of these components and a list of APIs and D3 plugins.

__09-01-2018__
I have converted the data of the different crimes to JSON files.

__10-01-2018__
I have converted all the data to JSON files and have made an index.html whereby you can open a site.

__11-01-2018__
I have made a stylesheet for the webpage and put a map of the world in the website, whithout the right data, but with titles, colors etc.

__14-01-2018__
Changed the data trough making one json file instead of nine json files, because this is easier to load in javascript for making the site. I have performed this by merging multiple dataframes. 


__15-01-2018__
Loaded the data in the javascript and arranged the data by making a dictionary with all the countries as keys and a list with the data from six sorts of crimes as value. I have chosen for this, because now you know exactly which data belongs to which country and its easy to take a specific value out of the data. I have also looked trough another world map, because the last map used two letter codes of the countries and I want to use one with three letter codes, because it's easier to change a country name to a three letter code.
